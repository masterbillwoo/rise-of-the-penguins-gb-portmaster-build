# GodotSteam

GodotSteam is a Steamworks SDK integration for Godot Engine.

For PortMaster builds, place the appropriate Linux .so files in the linux64 directory:
- libgodotsteam.linux.template_debug.x86_64.so
- libgodotsteam.linux.template_release.x86_64.so
- libsteam_api.so

The .so files can be obtained from the original Godot project's addons/godotsteam/linux64 directory.

Note: Steam functionality may not be available on all PortMaster devices.
